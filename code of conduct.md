# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Code Fellows community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be immediately removed from any current classes, refunded according to the terms of their student contract, and banned from the community.

## Community Goal: Be Kind

Our community of staff, instructors, and current &amp; former students strives to be kind. This is the guiding principle for conducting oneself within the Code Fellows community.

While kindness can be generally understood, we recognize that kindness in a professional setting means (but is not limited to):

- **Be friendly and patient**
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community who welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
- **Give attribution, engage honestly**: Since our code often depends on the work and assistance of others, we will be sure to give proper attribution. As members of the community, we agree to represent ourselves truthfully, claim only work that is our own, properly attribute collaborations, and engage honestly in all assignments.
- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all of the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Your presence may not impact other's ability to learn.
- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of learning professionals and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others both within the community and beyond the community. Do not insult, minimize, marginalize, or put down other participants, cultures, or sub-cultures. Contribute positively to the learning environment. 
- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity&mdash;people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
- **Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.**
